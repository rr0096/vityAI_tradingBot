The RSI indicates oversold conditions but does not show strong bullish momentum. MACD shows a bearish crossover, and ADX suggests a strong trend, which could be sideways or trending based on the recent price action. The current price is near the middle band of Bollinger Bands, indicating no clear breakout signal. Given these factors, it's prudent to hold rather than take a directional trade.\",\n  \"confidence_level\": \"MEDIUM\",\n  \"key_patterns_observed\": null,\n  \"temporal_analysis\": \"The price shows a lateral trend with minor fluctuations, and the recent volume is low compared to average, suggesting lack of strong buying or selling pressure.
