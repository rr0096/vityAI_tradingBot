  <em>
    Hi! I'm Giovanni, but I prefer to be called Ganador. This is my second project. For the last two months, I've been researching the latest in AI and algorithmic trading to develop Fenix. It's not perfect yet, it's not profitable, and there are still many things to improve. But after so much research, I'm convinced that Fenix's path is a tough and underdeveloped one that could surpass ordinary bots and reach the state of the art. I publish my project hoping it will be useful to someone, and I truly hope we can make Fenix rise and work as I dream.

# Fenix Trading Bot

## üìú The Fenix Philosophy: Beyond Just a Bot

In a financial market that never sleeps, information overload is a trader's greatest enemy. Traditional bots are limited to tracking technical indicators, ignoring the context, sentiment, and real-world events that truly move prices.

Fenix is born from a different idea: to replicate and enhance the process of an elite team of analysts. Instead of a single algorithm, Fenix deploys a crew of AI agents, each an expert in a different domain. Like the mythical bird, the system is reborn with each analysis cycle, processing fresh information from all angles to make informed, robust, and adaptive decisions.

This isn't just a bot; it's a framework for automated market intelligence.

## üß† Collective Intelligence Architecture

The core of Fenix is a workflow orchestrated by CrewAI, where information flows through a collaborative and competitive analysis process.

### üìä Data Acquisition Layer
- **Market & Chart Data:** OHLCV prices, indicators, and high-resolution visual snapshots from TradingView.
- **Text Intelligence:** Financial news from multiple sources and the social pulse from platforms like Twitter and Reddit.
- **Sentiment Metrics:** The "Fear & Greed" index and other consolidated metrics.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The AI Analysis Crew
The data is processed by a team of specialized agents, each powered by an LLM optimized for its task:

- **VisualAnalystAgent:** Uses a vision model (LLaVA) to read price charts. Identifies candlestick patterns, chart formations (H&S, triangles), and support/resistance levels invisible to purely numerical analysis.
- **TechnicalAnalystAgent:** The quantitative expert. Processes raw market data to analyze an arsenal of indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.) and determine the strength and direction of the trend from a mathematical perspective.
- **SentimentAgent:** The market psychologist. Reads and understands the natural language of news and social media to gauge the overall sentiment, distinguishing between euphoria, panic, or neutrality.
- **QABBAValidatorAgent:** A quality assurance agent. Validates the coherence and logic of the reports generated by the other agents, ensuring the conclusions are not contradictory or illogical.

### üõ°Ô∏è Consensus & Guardian Oversight
- **ConsensusAgent:** Acts as the head of strategy. Receives all validated reports and has the complex task of weighing all evidence to form a market thesis and propose an action (BUY, SELL, HOLD).
- **TradeGuardianAgent:** The final supervisor and risk manager. Implements the "circuit breakers" and capital management rules. Reviews the ConsensusAgent's proposal and gives the final approval only if it aligns with user-defined risk parameters (e.g., volatility, max drawdown).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Execution & Memory
Once a trade is approved, the system executes it and learns from it.
- **PaperTradingSystem:** A high-fidelity simulator that models latency, slippage, and fees for realistic testing.
- **TradeMemory:** All trades and the agent reasonings that led to them are stored, creating an invaluable database for performance analysis and continuous strategy improvement.

## ‚ú® Standout Features

- ü§ñ **Heterogeneous Agent Architecture:** Advanced orchestration with CrewAI, selecting the best LLM for each specific task.
- üëÅÔ∏è **Visual Chart Analysis:** A pioneering capability in the open-source space for an AI to natively read and interpret chart patterns.
- üß† **Local & Private Intelligence:** Runs on Ollama, ensuring your strategies and data never leave your machine.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Multi-Layered Security:** From agent logic validation (QABBA) to circuit breakers (TradeGuardian), safety is a core design pillar.
- üß™ **Realistic Testing Environment:** The paper trading mode simulates real-world market imperfections for reliable strategy validation.
- üîß **Highly Configurable & Extensible:** Designed from the ground up to be modular, allowing users to easily add new agents, tools, or strategies.

üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements
The system is designed to run on consumer-grade hardware. These are the recommended specifications for an optimal experience.
Operating System: macOS (Apple Silicon recommended) or Linux.
CPU: An Apple Silicon chip (M1/M2/M3/M4) is recommended due to optimizations. A modern Intel/AMD processor should also work.
RAM: 16 GB is the recommended minimum. The system is engineered to run within this limit thanks to dynamic memory management. 8 GB may struggle significantly.
Disk Space: At least 25-30 GB of free space to install Ollama and the various language models.

## üèÅ Quickstart Guide

**Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ganador1/FenixAI_tradingBot.git
cd fenixtradingbot
```

**Set Up the Virtual Environment:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Install Dependencies:**
